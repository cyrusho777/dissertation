Scheduler Evaluation Summary
==========================

Test Case 1: Basic Resource Distribution
----------------------------------------------
Default Scheduler:
  - DRF Metric (lower is better): 0.0000
  - Avg Scheduling Latency: 0.0000 seconds

Scheduler with Extender:
  - DRF Metric (lower is better): 0.0000
  - Avg Scheduling Latency: 0.0000 seconds

Improvements:
  - Fairness Change: 0.00%
  - Latency Improvement: 0.00%


Test Case 2: Mixed Workload
---------------------------------
Default Scheduler:
  - DRF Metric (lower is better): 0.0000
  - Avg Scheduling Latency: 0.0000 seconds

Scheduler with Extender:
  - DRF Metric (lower is better): 0.0000
  - Avg Scheduling Latency: 0.0000 seconds

Improvements:
  - Fairness Change: 0.00%
  - Latency Improvement: 0.00%


Test Case 3: Scaling Test
-------------------------------
Default Scheduler:
  - DRF Metric (lower is better): 0.0000
  - Avg Scheduling Latency: 0.0000 seconds

Scheduler with Extender:
  - DRF Metric (lower is better): 0.0000
  - Avg Scheduling Latency: 0.0000 seconds

Improvements:
  - Fairness Change: 0.00%
  - Latency Improvement: 0.00%


Overall Conclusion:
-----------------
The scheduler extender does not show an improvement in resource fairness with an average improvement of 0.00% in DRF metrics.

Interestingly, the scheduler extender actually improves scheduling latency by -0.00%.
